                    <p>A HUSBAND died, while his wife sustained injuries after their motorcycle was hit by a car at around 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, December 5, 2024, along the national highway in Sitio Bliss, Barangay Pajo, Daanbantayan, Cebu.</p>
                    <p>The victims were identified as Gilbert Doble Arrabis and his wife, Edelita, both from Barangay Pajo.
    
                        The driver of Toyota Vios involved in the collision was identified as Kyle Neilsen Sastre, 26, also from Daanbantayan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Initial investigation conducted by Daanbantayan police under station commander Major Mark Anthony Villanueva revealed that Gilbert suddenly made a left turn toward the barangay hall, causing the collision with the car.
    
                        The couple was rushed by emergency rescue personnel to the Daanbantayan District Hospital, where Gilbert was declared dead on arrival.
                    </p>
                    <p>The incident was captured by the barangay hall’s CCTV camera, where a car was seen traveling at a high speed before the collision occurred.
    
                        Sastre is being held at the Daanbantayan Police Station, while waiting for an amicable settlement with the victims’ family.
                                
                        If no settlement is reached, the driver may be charged with reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, serious physical injury, and damage to property. (DVG, TPT)
