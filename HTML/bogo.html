                    <p>In the City’s continued commitment to safeguard its rich marine biodiversity, the 3rd Underwater Clean-up Drive at the Capitancillo Islet Marine Sanctuary was conducted by the City in partnership with National Agencies and private individuals, groups, and volunteers.

                        The Capitancillo Islet, a protected marine area off the coast of Bogo City, is renowned for its vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life. Despite its ecological significance, the sanctuary faces threats from marine debris,pollution, and corral killers- crown of thorns, prompting the necessity for regular clean-up efforts.
                        
                        This is organized by the local government unit through the City Environment and Natural Reasources Office and City of Bogo Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office in partnership with local divers group.

                    <p>[2]In its continued commitment to safeguarding marine biodiversity, the City conducted the 3rd Underwater Clean-up Drive at the Capitancillo Islet Marine Sanctuary. This initiative was made possible through the collaborative efforts of the City Government, National Agencies, private individuals, groups, and an army of dedicated volunteers.

                        Capitancillo Islet, located off the coast of Bogo City, is a beacon of marine conservation, renowned for its vibrant coral reefs and diverse aquatic life. <br><br>The islet is not just a natural treasure but also a vital habitat for various marine species. However, its ecological significance is under constant threat due to marine debris, pollution, and natural predators like the crown-of-thorns starfish that damage coral ecosystems. These challenges necessitate continuous and proactive conservation efforts.
                        
                        The event was spearheaded by the Local Government Unit (LGU) through the City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) and the City of Bogo Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO), in collaboration with local divers' groups. <br><br>These divers not only played a crucial role in the underwater clean-up but also contributed their expertise in identifying and safely removing threats to the marine sanctuary.
                        
                        Volunteers and stakeholders worked hand in hand to collect non-biodegradable waste such as plastics, fishing nets, and other debris that pose risks to marine life. Divers also focused on the removal of invasive crown-of-thorns starfish, which have been known to devastate coral reefs if left unchecked.
                        
                        Mayor [Insert Mayor's Name] emphasized the importance of community involvement in protecting marine ecosystems, stating, “Our collective action is essential to preserving Capitancillo Islet for future generations.<br><br>Together, we can ensure that our marine sanctuary remains a thriving habitat for countless species.”
                        
                        In addition to clean-up efforts, the event included an educational component where participants and local residents were briefed on sustainable practices to reduce marine pollution and support biodiversity conservation. The City also plans to integrate these clean-up drives into a long-term conservation strategy, ensuring regular monitoring and swift action to address emerging threats.
                        
                        The 3rd Underwater Clean-up Drive not only demonstrated the City's unwavering commitment to environmental preservation but also underscored the power of collaboration in tackling ecological challenges. With continued efforts, Capitancillo Islet can remain a sanctuary for marine life and a source of pride for the community.
